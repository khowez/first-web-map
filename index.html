  <h1 id="pageTitle">The Audubon Mural Project</h1>

  <div id="descriptionText"><b><i>The Audubon Mural Project</i></b> is a collaboration between the National Audubon Society and Gitler &amp_____ Gallery to create murals of climate-threatened birds throughout John James Audubon's old Harlem‐based neighborhood in New York City. The project is inspired by the legacy of the great American bird artist and pioneering ornithologist and is energized by Audubon’s groundbreaking report "Survival By Degrees." Audubon's scientists have found that climate change will threaten at least half of all North American birds with extinction, and that no bird will escape the impacts of climate-change-related hazards like increased wildfire and sea-level rise. The project commissions artists to paint murals to call attention to this problem.</div>
